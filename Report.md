# Report - Respitarion from ECG

## Goal

Our goal is to use Bitalino to acquire an electrocardiogram (ECG) and estimate the Respiratory Rate (RR) from that signal.

## Team

* Ana Esteves
* Débora Pera
* Gonçalo Telo

## Process

We passed by the several steps:

### Step 1 - First recording

During the first stage/step we recorded data twice, using different sampling frequencies (1000 and 100 samples per second).

This was the first signal extracted from bitalino, with a sampling frequnecy of 1000 samples per second:

This was the second signal extracted from bitalino, with a sampling frequnecy of 100 samples per second:

### Step 2 - Improved signal

...


### Step 3 - Defining the signal processing stages

### Step 4 - Real time tests

### Step 5 - The final outcome

## Code example


``` python
from numpy import *
from pylab import *
s = randn(100)
plot(s)
show()

```
